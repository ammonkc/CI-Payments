# Driver based payments for Codeigniter

Finally, there is a payments library for Codeigniter taking advantage of the new CI 2.0 driver features. It's far from complete, but with your help could be something great. Thus far Paypal integration should work, although I haven't tested this library properly, it's not production ready just yet, but hopefully will be soon.
